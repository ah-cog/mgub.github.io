		  <p><code>TODO: Write lead-in sentence motivating the use of graphical programming environments.</code></p>

		  <p>Users can directly specify the actions of individual Pixels with the graphical programming environment. Users interact with the GPE through touches, holding, and dragging (with a finger) along the surface of a mobile, touch-screen display. The GPE is shown in the figure below.</p>

		  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qff5ucpoezmeft8/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-04%20at%209.42.49%20PM.png?raw=1" alt="" />
		  <br /><!-- TODO: Delete break. -->

		  <p><code>TODO: Make each image clickable, and show in lightbox-style viewer.</code></p>

		  <p>The behavior of each Pixel is represented in the GPE as a series of actions on a circular “loop” construct. This sequence is stored in each module’s random access memory (RAM), and can be changed dynamically to affect Pixel behavior in real time. The loop is directed clockwise, as indicated by the arrow positioned near the “end” point on the circular arc. This arrow indicates the order in actions will be performed by the corresponding Pixel.</p>

		  <p>To create actions, a user touches at any single point on the screen. At the moment of touch, one of two actions could be taken. The user could lift the finger from the screen just after touching it, resulting in a quick tap, to create a placeholder for an action, represented as a circle (Figure 11a). Alternatively, the user could continue touching the screen, summoning a palette of potential actions that the module could do (Figure 11b). Touching an action on the palette selects it, hiding all actions in the palette except the selected one. Similarly, to select an action for a placeholder, a user would tap the placeholder, summoning the action palette, and then touch a chosen action.</p>

		  <p>The loop drawn on the screen is a placeholder for a sequence of actions (see Figure 12). Actions can be dropped on and taken off the loop by dragging and dropping them, adding or removing it from the module’s behavior. The actions on the loop are called engaged actions, and are performed by the module on its next performance (or iteration). The actions off the loop are called disengaged actions. Tapping a disengaged action causes Pixel to perform it spontaneously.</p>

		  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5553kbmfgqh8r3g/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-04%20at%209.43.21%20PM.png?raw=1" alt="" />
		  <br /><!-- TODO: Delete break. -->

		  <p>By focusing on transformations of a module’s behavior that can be done through simple gestures, this interaction design aims to give nontechnical users an alternative experience to that of traditional programming languages. This design is based on the “gentle cause and great effect” relationship between a sculptor’s touch on wet clay and the resulting transformation of form while it spins on a potter’s wheel.</p>

		  <p>To facilitate behavior transformation with the graphical interface, Pixel carries out the actions on the loop on behalf of the user. Pixel handles interactions that take place through the performance of simple gestures and the direct manipulation of visual constructs corresponding to behaviors.</p>
