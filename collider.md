Collider is an experimental workspace on the University of Maryland, College Park campus designed to empower students by giving them complete autonomy and control over the physical space, organizational structure, and the creative ideals they embody.

I founded Collider along with Shariq Hashme and Kunal Sharma, two fellow student hackers. We created Collider to provide students with a place to explore their creative ideas with each other through playful building with electronics, acrylic paints and traditional art supplies, wood and other building materials, and classic toys, including wooden blocks.

<h2>Defining Collider</h2>

<!-- TODO: Style Collider as a definition from a dictionary. -->

Collider is an ongoing experiment. We decided to define <em>Collider</em> with an algorithm that represented a small set of core principles that help preserve it as an ongoing experiment while allowing it to develop a unique creative culture.

<!-- TODO: Include the set of principles and the algorithm from Eindhoven slides. -->

Defining Collider algorithmically allowed us to avoid specifying an explicit organizational structure.

I feel that Collider provides students with contrast to their experiences meeting academic deadlines and being evaluated by grades and anonymous metrics devoid of individual personality and context. This resulted in Collider being shaped by creative anarchy. An important aspect of the experiment was to foster creative collaborations (or collisions) between students from diverse backgrounds and pursuits, we directly invited students majoring in a range of topics.

<h2>Output</h2>

So far, Collider has produced the following artifacts.

<!-- This resulted in messy social interactions, including power struggles and the feeling of losing control for those who wanted to have some. -->

Sample of some works that were made: cozy Jenga table center piece with chairs and red carpet (to make the space cozier and more approachable), the bat + website to determine presence, the door face, painted circuit boards, the self-aware skateboard, Révolution (below)

<h3>Révolution</h3>

<p>Révolution is an episodic series of moments that capture improvised or found moments of creativity. The footage is found and improvised.</p>

<h3>Recursion: Collider ⇆ Bitcamp (Hack)</h3>

<p>We deployed specific elements from Collider at the center of Bitcamp that students recognized as the then-iconic look and feel of Collider.</p>

<h2>Collider is self-replicating.</h2>

The way that Collider was defined allows it to be replicated and adapted to fit other contexts and develop unique cultures that reflect their communities. Some additional Colliders are being designed by groups in Los Angeles, the Netherlands, and possibly Pittsburgh.
