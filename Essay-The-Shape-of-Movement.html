<em>Electronics &amp; The Shape of Movement</em><br />
</p>

<p>
As I worked with the cross-cutting demographic of makers constituted primarily of kids, artists, hackers, and enthusiasts, I noticed recurring patterns of behavior, psychology, and cognition that arose in the creative process. These patterns are physical constraint on the body, perceived limitations in the space of creative possibilities (biased by materials at hand, the space, people to help and support and inspire, and prior skill), perceived expectation and natural interest in the activity taking place, constraints on the ability to expand into the space or environment, constraints on embeddability, limitations on physical system topology (i.e., your system needs to be connected to a computer for control, as when using Scratch and MaKey MaKey), and constraints on physical mobility.<br />

After working with these ideas for a couple years, assessing many development boards and systems-making toolkits, it appears that these limitations actually non-intuitive. This surprises me because they seem so obvious. My best explanation for the non-intuitive nature of these constraints and limitations is that the <em>constraints and limitations are themselves mental barriers that aren't exposed for criticism due to lack of skill to do anything about it or lack of interest in the actual work involved in doing something to change them.</em> This is what I started Computer Camp to address. Given this background of observations and explanations, it's easy to see why Computer Camp focuses on <em>interactive media</em> tools_ and <em>efficient tool designs for creative enthusiasts, amateurs, and professionals</em>. Simply put, they encounter incredible friction in the creative process despite exhibiting incredible enthusiasm for <em>what can be done</em> with electronic media.<br />
