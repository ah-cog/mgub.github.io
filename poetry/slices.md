<strong>slices</strong><br /><br />
But I don't know how to dance.<br />
It doesn't matter, just go with it.<br />
Just don't care.<br />
Just don't care.<br />
I really don't know what I'm doing, maybe if I act like I'm nervous?<br />
When I'm nervous I dance a little.<br />
Just don't care.<br />
Nobody cares.<br />
Dance, come on, dance.<br />
Hi, what's your name?<br />

_Written on August 26, 2007._

_This was inspired by a chance encounter with a stranger who was eager to dance with me while at an Eagle Seagull concert at the beginning of my sophomore year at UNL._
