__natural alarms, probably__

you also arouse me physically<br />
two nights ago actually<br />
i layed awake in bed for an hour or so<br />
unable to get comfortable because<br />
the things that make me male<br />
would not let me be<br />
and because you are my love<br />
and a drop-dead eye-provoking<br />
and lower-region-stoking<br />
come-here-and-let-me-hold-you-and-let-my-hands-slide-low<br />
young female<br />
my eyes did not sleep when they shut<br />
they instead displayed to me<br />
you<br />
naughty<br />
naughty<br />
i am slightly aroused right now in writing even<br />

silly me<br />
you make me smile all sorts of smiles<br />
