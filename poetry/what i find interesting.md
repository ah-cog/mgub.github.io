__what i find interesting__

my math professor notices which numbers people choose.<br />
he asked for numbers to use in his example,<br />
and was seemingly intrigued when he noticed<br />
that no negatives or zero were chosen.<br />
he speaks of math as a language and a tool to represent thought.<br />
he probably finds the real world quite scary.<br />
i wonder if he finds comfort in numbers.<br />

an acquaintance of mine seems to notice things about words.<br />
she appreciates the shape of them,<br />
and how they appear or function with one another,<br />
and their interesting or artistic use.<br />
she speaks of words and their meaning as different things.<br />
she must have thought about words a lot.<br />

people find things interesting.<br />
