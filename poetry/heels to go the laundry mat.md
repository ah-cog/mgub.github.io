__heels to go the laundry mat__

i want a pair of jeans<br />
a pair of loose fitting<br />
loose fit sort of harem jeans<br />
even like the cheap ones<br />
it’s like the fit<br />
they’re so big<br />
this is a straight leg jean<br />
but actually its not<br />
it’s like skin tight<br />
people need clothes made specifically for them<br />
i need pants that don’t actually go like this<br />
from the hip area to the waist area<br />
like falling off of my waist like 7 inches<br />
like i can’t get it over my ass<br />
alexis has like these really awesome pants<br />
i don’t know if they’re like harem pants<br />
they’re like really big on your thigh<br />
i was like where did you get this<br />
and she was like<br />
the thrift store<br />
it’s just so irritating<br />
