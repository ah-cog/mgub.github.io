__two blue oceans__

the boy on the street says we’re two blue oceans<br />
does he know what everyone is<br />
we drifted along the pavement relatively elegantly<br />
toward the general spot of popular sweets<br />
of a population of frost and people<br />
craving for qualities more than the<br />
there’s something in the air<br />
honey banana<br />
snapped photographs floating ships<br />
anchoring in time along the urban wave<br />
sneaking under fountains and playing<br />
are we the same two blue oceans<br />
that later chase in our way the centipede into the wine glass<br />
could they possess creativity<br />
even though they have one hundred legs<br />
