<p>
it was an old gun back then<br />
but this is not something where you can take any chances<br />
i gotta figure a way to get that gun out of the house<br />
but i may be paranoid<br />
it's too much to figure out<br />
i don't think i'd worry about that<br />
you know what people have said<br />
i wanted to make a police report<br />
and five minutes later<br />
they had an officer at my parents house<br />
they went in to talk to my father<br />
and this woman<br />
i hate to scare the shit out of this woman<br />
but i understand there's been some money<br />
maybe she's gone through his papers<br />
what i'm scared of is if she tries to steel stuff<br />
out of my father's house<br />
