    <p>Bitcamp is the primary collegiate hackathon at the University of Maryland,
College Park.</p>

<p>I am one of the original founders of Bitcamp (http://bitca.mp) and helped
organize the first Bitcamp in the spring of 2014. Bitcamp was the first
national collegiate hackathon hosted by the University of Maryland, College
Park. About 750 college students participated in the first Bitcamp.</p>

<p>Bitcamp is one of the main collegiate hackathons. Notably, it is in Division I
of the Major League Hacking hackathon series.</p>

<h2>Naming Bitcamp</h2>

<p>I named Bitcamp with the support of several of the original founders, notably
my friend Jeff Hilnbrand. Jeff kindly shared a screenshot of the original
Facebook conversation which gave rise to the name.</p>

<!-- TODO: Insert screenshot of Facebook conversation. -->

<p><a href="http://bitca.mp">Website</a>, <a href="http://bitcamp.devpost.com/submissions">Project Submissions</a> (on <a href="http://bitcamp.devpost.com/">Devpost</a>)</p>

<h2>Collider at Bitcamp</h2>

<p>I lead a spontaneous effort to deploy Collider right in the middle of Bitcamp.
In the final stages of setting up Bitcamp, I recruited some friends who
frequently visited Collider to help me move some key elements of Collider to
the heart of Bitcamp.</p>

<!-- TODO: Insert photo of Collider. -->

<p>I had no specific plans about what to do with Collider after relocating it,
but shortly after setting up the essential elements, it became center stage for
the opening ceremonies, including a talk about virtual reality from Brendan
Iribe. This took place quickly and organically.</p>

<p>The hack was deployed successfully and Collider&#39;s essential elements helped set
the tone for the event.</p>

<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>

<p>The primary corporate sponsor of Bitcamp was Oculus.</p>

<!-- TODO: Insert photo with Brendan. -->

<!-- TODO: Insert photo of me wearing the Oculus project with fans. -->

<h2>After the first Bitcamp</h2>

<p>Bitcamp caught the attention of the University and has since become an annual
event. It is still organized and run by students.</p>

<p>Part of Bitcamp&#39;s legacy is a community of students that have since organized
subsequent Bitcamp events. Many of these students are hackers that actively
 participate in other hackathons.</p>
