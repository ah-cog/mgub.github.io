  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I cofounded Collider along with two other students. Collider is an experimental creative space on the University of Maryland, College Park campus. We created Collider in order to provide students with a place to explore their ideas through open-ended experimentation and creative building.</p>

<p>The space itself was set up as an on-going experiment. This provided students with on-campus contrast to their experiences meeting academic deadlines and being evaluated by grades and anonymous metrics devoid of individual personality and context. Collider was shaped by this creative anarchy. Part of the experiment was to foster creative collaborations (or collisions) between students from diverse backgrounds and pursuits, we directly invited students majoring in a range of topics. Collider encourages exploration of visionary ideas together through experimentation and making using a variety of materials.</p>

<p>So far, Collider has produced the following artifacts.</p>

<!-- This resulted in messy social interactions, including power struggles and the feeling of losing control for those who wanted to have some. -->

<!--
Sample of some works that were made: cozy Jenga table center piece with chairs and red carpet (to make the space cozier and more approachable), the bat + website to determine presence, the door face, painted circuit boards, the self-aware skateboard, Révolution (below)

<h1 class="page-heading">Révolution</h1>

<p>Révolution is an episodic series of moments that capture off beat moments of creativity. The footage is found and improvised.</p>

<h1 class="page-heading">Collider ⇆ Bitcamp (Hack)</h1>

<p>We deployed specific elements from Collider at the center of Bitcamp that students recognized as the then-iconic look and feel of Collider.</p>
