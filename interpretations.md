In this project, I explored (a) the creation of visual media through feedback production and manipulation and (b) the experience of control while participating in the creative process guided by a combination of subjective interpretation of accidental discovery. Feedback and experiences participating in its manipulation feedback were the primary subjects of this exploration. The Feedback Interpretations project resulted in video and image content.

<h2>Life/Breath</h2>

[Life/Breath](https://vimeo.com/35790466) is the first result of this project. The video was recorded in a single take and wasn't edited digitally. The only acts of control were starting and stopping the recording using the digital camcorder.

<h2>Feedback A</h2>

The single take for [Life/Breath](https://vimeo.com/35790466) was selected from several video recordings. Using this source footage, I produced a set of images named [Feedback A](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mokogobo/sets/72157626173999862/). The production of these images was accidental. When reviewing recorded videos, I unwittingly discovered a way to distort and combine parts of multiple frames from the source video footage to produce entirely novel images, absent from the source video. This "found filtering" process required my participation and produced somewhat predictable image distortions and artifacts while not being entirely predictable. The process felt coercive. This enabled me to experimentally generate digital effects _indirectly_ without the selecting specific effects prior to their application.

In the [Feedback A](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mokogobo/sets/72157626173999862/) image set, I utilized a "found filter" that required my participation and produced somewhat predictable image distortions and artifacts while not being entirely predictable. This enabled me to experimentally generate digital effects _indirectly_ without the selecting specific effects prior to their application.

<h2>Interpretations A</h2>

In the [Interpretations A](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mokogobo/sets/72157626048857093/) image set, I further experimented with image distortion and video feedback without the application of digital effects. The source footage of these images was shot during the same session as that of the Feedback A set. That means that the feedback loop was created using a HANNspree Xv32 32-inch Widescreen LCD HDTV (JT01-32U1-000G) displaying the output from a Canon Vixia HF11 digital camcorder capturing and playing back, live, the image shown by the television. In this project, I was exploring the particular video feedback created by my hardware, lighting, and other conditions as an expressive medium for creating images.

The distortion in these images was caused by moving the track bar from place to place in VLC while playing the captured MTS video file from a data DVD that contained the video. The distortion that this creates did not occur for other video formats that I tried.

<h2>Interpretations B Motion 1</h2>

[Interpretations B Motion 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD9XSFp3NM8) is a digital video that further explores the notions of process and licensing by using a variety of past and present, analog and digital technologies and both original and found digital content, all licensed and released under the Creative Commons license.

The video was created by recording the projection of a handcrafted 35mm film of repeating abstract digital forms, produced by adhering prints of digital images, printed on transparent sheets, to 35mm film. These digital images were created by digitally interlacing frames extracted from original video footage of natural formations and built architecture. The audio was created using found samples that were released under the Creative Commons License. The final video uses a combination of natural and synthesized audio and video elements, juxtaposed in attempt to expose common or similar structures essential to the nature of both elements.

This project is, in a sense, inherently interdisciplinary because it was created from an artistic perspective of a computer scientist but considers the important contemporary issues of process and licensing, which are subject to the analyses of many disciplines under various guises. For instance, the notion of a process is of concern, primarily in the context of process optimization, in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering. Likewise, the notion of process is of concern in theoretical and applied Computer Science. Licensing issues are crucially important in contemporary society, particularly in the context of digital distribution. Licensing is a topic of importance in Political Science, Computer Science, and Sociology. This project is both a reflection and an expression of these contemporary issues through an artistic means.

I created this film by filming the projection of a 35mm reel of film, using a digital camcorder. The 35mm reel of film was created by hand. To the film I attached three color prints, printed on transparencies using and inkjet printer. The prints were selected from my collection of still images named Interpretations A.
