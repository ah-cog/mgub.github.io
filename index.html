    <div class="text">
      I'm a software engineer with a background in human-computer interaction in San Francisco. In my work, I actively look opportunities to collaborate, especially through teaching and learning while solving technical problems, to grow my team's ability to efficiently solve problems individually and together. 
      I have worked extensively with non-technical people and teams 
      to identify how to apply technology creatively to solve meaningful problems. I tend to choose the domains I work in deliberaly, namely 
      education and learning, collaborative knowledge work, and human-centered applications of artificial intelligence. I tend prefer to start working on projects in their nascent stages. I have worked closely with individuals exploring novel technologies, 
      early-stage startups to build and scale their technology and teams, and enable research groups to focus on doing publishable research. Get in touch if you'd like to work together or for more information about
      my past work (see below).
