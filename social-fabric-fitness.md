<p>Social Fabric Fitness was a research project that explored the use of three custom-built e-textile displays to support running groups. I worked on this project with Matt Mauriello and Jon Froehlich as part of the Makeability Lab in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

<p>I developed two custom wearable displays. One of them was an LED display that I designed from scratch and the other was developed using an early E Ink display. I also initiated the collaboration that lead to using prototype units of the third display. I also made the trailer video below, however it was heavily directed by Jon Froehlich.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

During this project, I became deeply interested in documentation as a medium for personal expression, for communicating narrative content, and as a tool for communicating the complexities of creative processes. Some samples of my photo and video documentation are below.
