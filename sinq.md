SINQ (an abbreviation of Scientific INQuiry) is an application for the Apple iPad (and other iOS devices), designed to help guide children in the development of scientific inquiry projects in the everyday contexts of their lives. It was a research project in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) at the University of Maryland, College Park led by June Ahn, a professor in the College of Information Studies and College of Education and Michael Gubbels, a Human-Computer Interaction M.S. student in the College of Information Studies. The project was chosen as a finalist at the Microsoft Research Social Media Expo at the iConference 2013. Publications and source code for SINQ are provided on this page. SINQ has been released for deployment within classrooms or educational groups.
